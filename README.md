Calculator:
This Python script implements a basic calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

Description:
The calculator script prompts the user to enter two numbers (a and b) and select an operation (+, -, *, /, %). It then computes the result based on the selected operation and displays it.

Operations Supported:
Addition (+): Adds two numbers together.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second.
Modulus (%): Computes the remainder when dividing the first number by the second.
Usage

To use the calculator:
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Follow the prompts to enter the values of a and b.
Choose an operation from the list (+, -, *, /, %).
The script will compute and display the result of the operation.

Error Handling:
ZeroDivisionError: If attempting to divide by zero, the script will print a message: "You cannot divide by zero."
ValueError: If invalid input (non-numeric characters) is entered for a or b, the script will print a message: "Please enter valid numbers."
Invalid Operation: If an invalid operation is selected, the script will print: "Invalid operation."
